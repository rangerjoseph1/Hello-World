# Hello-World
This is my first repository, I'm using the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

I am a second year Computer Information System student at the University of the Fraser Valley in Canada. I created this account beacause I want to spend more time on recreational programing projects, and because I want to have better documentation of the projects I work on. Aditionally, It probably won't hurt me to become familiar with GitHub.
